# Introduction
## Who this book is for
This book has a few target audiences with different sections being most relevant for each.

### Test Automation Engineers
First and foremost, this book is for the people out there who write the majority
of automated tests and testing frameworks.

While the patterns and techniques in this book should be helpful for this group,
I hope the discussions about the philosophy of testing and automation are just as -
 if not more - helpful.

### Engineering and QA Managers
Managers are not generally writing automation code every day, so some of the
more specific technical discussions may be less useful, but I hope they will
provide some insight into the challenges automation engineers face and some potential solutions.

The philosophy discussions should be particularly relevant to this group, of course.
It is critical that those in management are clear about the goals and purpose of
automated testing, since that will drive hiring decisions, performance evaluations,
etc.
